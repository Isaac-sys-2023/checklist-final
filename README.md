This is a project that serves as a web todo app with NestJS as the backend and NextJS as the frontend. It was created to practice skills with these tools and also as a way to procrastinate to avoid working on my thesis project. However, since I didnâ€™t want to procrastinate doing something unproductive, I brainwashed myself into making this thing, which in turn will help me manage my daily tasks instead of using existing tools out of sheer laziness.
